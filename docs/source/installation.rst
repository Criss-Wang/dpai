Installation
============

Dpai requires python 3.8+ and can work on Linux/MacOs/Windows. For this plugin tool to function properly, you need to ensure you have model files in the form of ``*.joblib`` and inference files with ``input_fn`` and ``predict_fn`` implemented. Ensure third party dependencies are installed so that these two functions can run properly and the model can load correctly.

The preferred way to install Dpai is via pip

.. code-block::

    pip install dpai


You can also download the source code and build it yourself.
